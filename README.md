# Gender-Detection-Using Python Keras and OpenCV on live camera

## About the Project
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.<br>

## After executing the program, you will be able to know:
<ul>
<li>Face detection is a non-trivial computer vision problem for identifying and localizing faces in images.</li><br>
<li>Face detection can be performed using the classical feature-based cascade classifier using the OpenCV library.</li><br>
<li>State-of-the-art face detection can be achieved using a Multi-task Cascade CNN via the MTCNN library.</li><br>
</ul>

## Related Algorithms:
<ul>
<li>Face detection can be regarded as a specific case of object-class detection. Examples include upper torsos, pedestrians, and cars.</li><br>
<li>Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces. Any facial feature changes in the database will invalidate the matching process.</li><br>
<li>A reliable face-detection approach based on the genetic algorithm and the eigen-face techniques.</li><br>
</ul>
